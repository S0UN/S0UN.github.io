My name is Victor Tangton and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin where I will be studying Computer Science and Business. In the past,  I have participated in two research projects at the University of North Texas: the first involved developing a code equivalence analysis tool for distinguishing between patched and unpatched code to enhance software security; the second focused on creating a video game simulation to assess an individual's personality trait. I will be interning Summer of 2024 at Oakridge National Laboratory, working on Generative AI problems with a particular focus on Natural Language Processing of Scientific Texts.
